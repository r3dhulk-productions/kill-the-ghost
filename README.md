# KillTheGhost
This project is a simple vanilla JavaScript and CSS game that I made. To store the score, I used localStorage.
 To score it, you have to hover the mouse over the ghost - try to score as much as you can! Have fun!

As I used localStorage, the score will be stored in your PC. If you want to clean up, 
you can copy and paste this command in your browser console: "localStorage.clear();". 

Important: Although the game is working on mobile devices, it's not going to work really well,
 because the game is using the mousehover function to score it. Maybe I'll change that in the future.
